# 👋 Hi, I'm Amith Shaik  

I’m an aspiring **Python developer** with a background in software testing, IT coordination, and technical support.  
I enjoy solving problems, automating repetitive tasks, and learning how to build reliable, real-world applications with Python.  

My experience working with teams at **Amazon**, **Kelly Connect**, and **Walmart** helped me develop strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a structured approach to learning and troubleshooting.  
Now, I’m applying those skills to grow into a full-time Python development role.
